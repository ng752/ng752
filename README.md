üí° More About Me

Hello! I'm Niklas, a passionate software developer and apprentice in the exciting world of technology. With a focus on Java, I thrive in building robust and efficient software solutions. I love diving into new technologies and frameworks, constantly expanding my knowledge and honing my skills.

During my scholar apprenticeship at CBS, I have gained hands-on experience in software development, web development, and database management. I enjoy the challenges that come with creating responsive web applications using modern tools and frameworks such as Angular and React. Additionally, I find great satisfaction in designing and optimizing databases to ensure efficient data management.

I am also captivated by the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Exploring the vast possibilities of AI and ML, I am keen on leveraging data-driven insights to develop intelligent applications that make a positive impact.

As an avid learner, I continuously strive to stay updated with the latest industry trends and advancements. I am a firm believer in the power of collaboration and teamwork, fostering an environment where innovative ideas can flourish.

Outside of coding, you can find me exploring the outdoors, reading sci-fi novels, or engaging in thought-provoking discussions on tech-related topics.

Let's connect and embark on a journey of creativity, problem-solving, and innovation together!
